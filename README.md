# chapel-heap
This is a repo for my primitive `heap` module for Chapel.

One of my goals is to take examples from the standard library as much as possible thus making it more easy to be merged into the Chapel official repo.

Here's the progress I have made so far:
* Heap is fully implemented as a mason module.
* Correctness tests are provided.
* A basic example of using this module is provided.
* Apply `Comparators` to better integrate with other parts of Chapel.
* [Documentation](https://rapiz1.github.io/chapel-heap) in source are well-formatted and have been built into pages by `mason doc`.

BTW, I'm an undergraduate student from HUST in China and targeting the topic "Sequential Data Structures" of GSoC 2020. I have a rather good knowledge of data structures and algorithms and have won one gold medal and one bronze medal in ICPC(The International Collegiate Programming Contest) Asia Regional Contest. 

I'm looking forward to your feedback : )
